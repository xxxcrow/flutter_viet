## Passion Fruit

Passion fruit is the perfect mix of sour and sweet. It is a small purple fruit, normally the size of a fist. The purple rind is thick and difficult to open sometimes. Beyond the outer skin, lies a white inside with hundreds of bright yellow juice-filled pods with black seeds. The seeds are edible so you can simply scoop the insides out and devour them.
